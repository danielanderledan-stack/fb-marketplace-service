            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="updated">Last updated: 15 February 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Our Services</h2>

                their items on online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace. Our services include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating optimised marketplace listings based on information and photos you provide</li>
                <li>Managing buyer communications and enquiries on your behalf</li>
                <li>Coordinating sale logistics</li>
                <li>Providing guidance on item presentation and photography</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use our services. By using our services, you represent and warrant
                that you are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

            <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>When using our services, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate and truthful information about items you wish to sell</li>
                <li>Ensure you are the legal owner of any items submitted for listing</li>
                <li>Provide clear, honest photos of your items as requested</li>

                <li>Not submit any illegal, stolen, or prohibited items for sale</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Fees and Commission</h2>
            <p>Our current fee structure is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Sale:</strong> Your first sale through our service is provided at no cost to you.</li>
                <li><strong>Subsequent Sales:</strong> We charge a commission on each completed sale after your first.
                    The current commission rate is displayed on our website and may be updated from time to time. You
                    will always be informed of applicable rates before a sale is finalised.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Commission is only charged on successfully completed sales. There are no upfront fees, monthly
                subscriptions, or hidden charges.</p>

            <h2>5. No Guarantees</h2>
            <p>While we strive to achieve the best possible outcomes, we do not guarantee:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>That any item will sell, or sell within a specific timeframe</li>
                <li>Any specific sale price or profit margin</li>
                <li>A specific number of views, enquiries, or buyer interactions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Results vary depending on item type, condition, market demand, and other factors outside our control.</p>

            <h2>6. Payments</h2>
            <p>After a successful sale, your share of the proceeds (sale price minus our commission) will be transferred
                to you. Payment timelines and methods will be agreed upon between you and MarketFlip.</p>

            <h2>7. Item Ownership and Liability</h2>
            <p>You retain ownership of your items at all times until a sale is completed. We act as your agent in
                creating listings and facilitating communication but do not take ownership or possession of your items
                unless otherwise agreed.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, MarketFlip shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
                special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, arising from your use of our
                services.</p>
